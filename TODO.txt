-Report fixes to matplotlib website
  qt4 backend has added most keys (except backspace. But it is still behind gtk)
  key_press_handler has not changed (still does not reorder overlayed axes so you can't
  see the x,y values except for the last axes.)
-Understand new Qt handler
-Check behavior of CTRL-C with Qt, pyHegel and command line
-write a script to create the shortcuts, setup the configuration files
-adjust selection mode of pyHegel window.

When updating to newer version:
  erase c:\Codes\console_c.xml
  replace desktop pyHegel_cmd with newer one.
